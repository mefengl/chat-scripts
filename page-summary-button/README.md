[*Doozy: AI made easy*, Waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco0ORt6OejFDi04wat5ZzrOblHHEzu_qAswneexrQ4A60Xsw/viewform?usp=sf_link): I really think it will be very useful. There won't be any junk mail or anything like that here. If you think this script is good, or can be even better, sign up and you can use it right away. There's an early product screenshot inside.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).
2. Click [chatgpt-page-summary-button](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/466322-chatgpt-page-summary-button) to go to the greasyfork page to install the userscript.
3. Visit any website, and you will see a Summary button at the top right corner of the page.

## Usage

When you visit a webpage with the userscript installed, you'll see a Summary button at the top right corner of the page. Click the button to send the text from the webpage to ChatGPT for summarization. **The summarized text will be displayed on the ChatGPT web interface**.
