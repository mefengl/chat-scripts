# ChatGPT Infinite

ChatGPT-Infinite is a UserScript that automates the process of generating questions in the OpenAI chat interface. This script asks ChatGPT to generate a question, and then asks the generated question back to ChatGPT.

> Use this responsibly. You may encounter an error if more than 60-70 conversations are generated per hour.
