[*Doozy: AI made easy*, Waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco0ORt6OejFDi04wat5ZzrOblHHEzu_qAswneexrQ4A60Xsw/viewform?usp=sf_link): I really think it will be very useful. There won't be any junk mail or anything like that here. If you think this script is good, or can be even better, sign up and you can use it right away. There's an early product screenshot inside.

## Usage

When you visit a webpage with the userscript installed, you'll see a Translate button at the topright corner of the page. Click the button to send the text from the webpage to Bard for translation. **The translated text will be displayed on the Bard web interface**.

The default language for translation in the script is the browser's local language. If you need to change it, please click on Tampermonkey menu to make corresponding modifications.
